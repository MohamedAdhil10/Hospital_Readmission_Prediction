# Hospital Readmission Prediction

---

## Project Overview

This project predicts hospital readmission likelihood for diabetic patients using **Machine Learning (Random Forest Classifier)** and visualizes insights in an **interactive Power BI dashboard**.  
It integrates **data preprocessing, model training, feature interpretation (SHAP), and business intelligence visualization** to support healthcare analytics and patient care improvement.

## About the Dataset

- **Dataset name:** `hospital_readmissions.csv`  
- **Source:** Publicly available diabetes hospital readmission dataset [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dubradave/hospital-readmissions).  
- **Rows:** ~25,000 hospital records  
- **Columns include:**
  - `age`, `medical_specialty`, `diag_1`, `diag_2`, `diag_3` (diagnoses)
  - `glucose_test`, `a1ctest`, `change`, `diabetes_med`
  - `time_in_hospital`, `n_procedures`, `n_lab_procedures`, `n_medications`
  - `n_outpatient`, `n_inpatient`, `n_emergency`
  - `readmitted` → Target column (“Yes” or “No”)  

The dataset is cleaned, standardized, and transformed for predictive modeling.

---
## Objectives

- Predict the probability of **patient readmission within 30 days**.  
- Identify **key clinical and demographic factors** influencing readmission.  
- Generate a **Power BI-ready dataset** for interactive visual insights.  
- Help hospitals **optimize care and reduce readmission rates**.

---

## Workflow

### 1 Data Preparation
- Loaded dataset: `hospital_readmissions.csv`
- Cleaned and standardized column names.
- Created binary target variable: `readmit_30` (1 = readmitted, 0 = not readmitted).

### 2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Readmission rate distribution.
- Average hospital stay vs. readmission.
- Readmission by medical specialty, diagnosis, diabetes medication, and A1C test.

### 3 Model Pipeline
- **Feature Engineering:** Encoded categorical features and scaled numerics.  
- **Model Used:** Random Forest Classifier  
- **Optimization:** GridSearchCV (Hyperparameter tuning)
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - ROC AUC  
  - PR AUC  
  - Accuracy  
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score 

### 4 Feature Explainability (SHAP)
- Used **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to interpret feature importance.
- Extracted top 3 most impactful features for each prediction.
- Exported summary plots (`shap_summary.png`) and feature importance table (`feature_importance_top40.csv`).

### 5 Power BI Dashboard Integration
- Created **dashboard_table.csv** with columns:
  - `top1, top1_val, top2, top2_val, top3, top3_val, pred_readmit_prob, actual_readmit`
- Designed Power BI visuals to analyze model outcomes and key features.

## Model Performance

| Metric             | Score |
| :----------------- | :---: |
| ROC AUC (Tuned RF) | ~0.65 |
| PR AUC             | ~0.60 |
| Accuracy           | ~0.61 |
| Precision          | ~0.60 |
| Recall             | ~0.61 |

## Model File

* The trained model file **best_rf_readmit_corrected.pkl** is not included in this repository due to file size limitations.
* To reproduce the model, simply run all cells in the Jupyter notebook hospital_readmission_analysis.ipynb.
* This will retrain the Random Forest model and generate the .pkl file automatically during execution.

---

## Key Insights

* **A1C Test** and **Glucose Levels** are strong predictors of readmission.
* Patients with **longer hospital stays** tend to have higher readmission probabilities.
* Certain **medical specialties** show disproportionately high readmission rates.
* SHAP analysis provides transparent feature-level explanations for clinical decision support.
